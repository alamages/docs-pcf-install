This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure.

Before you perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the procedures in the [Preparing to Deploy PCF on Azure](azure-prepare-env.html) topic, and either the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](azure-arm-template.html) topic or the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template](azure-om-deploy.html) topic. 

After you complete the procedures in this topic, follow the instructions in the [Deploying PAS on Azure](azure-er-config.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id='access-om'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager that you set up in either the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](azure-arm-template.html) topic or the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template](azure-om-deploy.html) topic. 
1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider (IdP) ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("azure/om-resource-config.png") %>

1. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkboxes are deselected for all jobs. 
1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 9: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If a red ICMP error message appears and you have disabled ICMP, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

1. Ops Manager Director installs. This may take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. When Ops Manager finishes deploying, you can optionally [deploy BOSH Add-Ons](./add-ons.html) to your system, and then [install one or more PCF runtime environments](./runtimes.html) to complete your PCF installation.
