The following are general requirements for deploying and managing a PCF deployment with Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime:

* (**Recommended**) Ability to create a wildcard DNS record to point to your
router or load balancer.
Alternatively, you can use a service such as xip.io. For example, `203.0.113.0.xip.io`.
<br /><br />
    Elastic Runtime gives each application its own hostname in your app domain.
    With a wildcard DNS record, every hostname in your domain resolves to the IP
    address of your router or load balancer, and you do not need to configure an
    A record for each app hostname. For example, if you create a DNS record
    `*.example.com` pointing to your router, every application deployed to the
    `example.com` domain resolves to the IP address of your router.

* (**Recommended**) A network without DHCP available for deploying the Elastic
Runtime VMs
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have DHCP, refer to the Troubleshooting Guide to avoid issues with your installation.</p>

* Sufficient IP allocation:
  * One IP address for each VM instance
  * An additional IP address for each instance that requires static IP addresses
  * An additional IP address for each errand
  * An additional IP address for each compilation worker:
`IPs needed = VM instances + static IPs + errands + compilation workers`
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH requires that you allocate a sufficient number of additional dynamic IP addresses when configuring a reserved IP range during installation. BOSH uses these IP addresses during installation to compile and deploy VMs, install Elastic Runtime, and connect to services. We recommend that you allocate at least 36 dynamic IP addresses when deploying Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime.

* One or more NTP servers if not already provided by your IaaS
