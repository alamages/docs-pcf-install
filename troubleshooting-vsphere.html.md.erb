This guide provides help with diagnosing and resolving issues that are specific to [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployments on VMware vSphere.

For infrastructure-agnostic troubleshooting help, refer to [Diagnosing Problems in PCF](./diagnostics.html).

## <a id='common_probs'></a>Common Issues ##

The following sections list common issues you might encounter and possible resolutions.

### <a id='vcenter-setting'></a> PCF Installation Fails ###

If you modify the vCenter Statistics Interval Duration setting from its default setting of 5 minutes, the PCF installation might fail at the MicroBOSH deployment stage, and the logs might contain the following error message:
`The specified parameter is not correct, interval`. This failure happens because Ops Manager expects a default value of 5 minutes, and the call to this method fails when the retrieved value does not match the expected default value.

To resolve this issue, launch vCenter, navigate to **Administration > vCenter Server Settings > Statistics**, and reset the vCenter Statistics Interval Duration setting to 5 minutes.

### <a id='bosh_install'></a>BOSH Automated Installation Fails ###

Before starting an Elastic Runtime deployment, you must set up and configure a vSphere cluster.

If you enable vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for the cluster, you must set the Automation level to **Partially automated** or **Fully automated**.

If you set the Automation level to **Manual**, the BOSH automated installation will fail with a `power_on_vm` error when BOSH attempts to create virtual VMs.

### <a id='net-settings'></a>Ops Manager Loses Its IP Address After HA or Reboot ###

Ops Manager can lose its IP address and use DHCP due to an issue in the open source version of VMware Tools. Review the [support topic](https://discuss.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/222603488) for this issue in order to troubleshoot this problem.

### <a id='net-settings'></a>Cannot Connect to the OVF Via a Browser ###

If you deployed the OVF file but cannot connect to it via a browser, check that
the network settings you entered in the wizard are correct.

1. Access the PCF installation VM using the vSphere Console.
If your network settings are misconfigured, you will not be able to SSH into
the installation VM.

1. Log in using the credentials you provided when you imported the PCF
.ova in vCenter.

1. Confirm that the network settings are correct by checking that the ADDRESS,
NETMASK, GATEWAY, and DNS-NAMESERVERS entries are correct in
`/etc/network/interfaces`.

1. If any of the settings are wrong, run `sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces` and
correct the wrong entries.

1. In vSphere, navigate to the **Summary** tab for the VM and confirm that the
network name is correct.

1. If the network name is wrong, right click on the VM, select **Edit Settings > Network adapter 1**, and select the correct network.

1. Reboot the installation VM.

### <a id='communication'></a>Installation Fails with Failed Network Connection ###

If you experience a communication error while installing Ops Manager or MicroBOSH Director, check the following settings.

* Ensure that the routes are not blocked. vSphere environments use [NSX](http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html) for firewall, NAT/SNAT translation and load balancing.
All communication between PCF VMs and vCenter or ESXi hosts route through the NSX firewall and are blocked by default.

* Open port 443. Ops Manager and MicroBOSH Director VMs require access to vCenter and all ESX through port 443.

* Allocate more IP addresses. BOSH requires that you allocate a sufficient number of additional dynamic IP addresses when configuring a reserved IP address range during installation. BOSH uses these IP addresses during installation to compile and deploy VMs, install Elastic Runtime, and connect to services. We recommend that you allocate at least 36 dynamic IP addresses when deploying Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime.
