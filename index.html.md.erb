This documentation describes the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 

## <a id='intro'></a>Introduction

This section describes how a Small Footprint Elastic Runtime deployment differs from a standard deployment. 

### <a id='compare'></a>VM Comparison

A standard, highly available Elastic Runtime deployment has 31 VMs and  requires [50 or more instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/aws.html#aws). Some resource-constrained environments that run smaller workloads can benefit from an Elastic Runtime deployment with a minimal footprint. The Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile requires only four VMs. 

The following image compares the number of VMs deployed by Elastic Runtime and Small Footprint Elastic Runtime.

### <a id='usecase'></a>Use Cases

The Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile satisfies the following use cases:

* **Small on-premise installations**: You want to run PCF in a small data center or other resource-constrained environment.
* **Proof-of-concept installations**: You want to deploy PCF quickly and with a small footprint for evaluation or testing purposes. 
* **Service tile R&D**: You develop a service tile for PCF and you want to test it against Small Footprint Elastic Runtime instead of a standard Elastic Runtime deployment to reduce cost. 

The Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile is not recommended for most production deployments. The tile has significant performance and capacity restraints. A standard Elastic Runtime deployment is better equipped to handle production workloads and scale to meet your needs. 

## <a id='arch'></a>Architecture

You can deploy the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile with a minimum of four VMs, as shown in the image below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following image assumes that you are using an external blobstore.</p>

To reduce the number of VMs required for Small Footprint Elastic Runtime, the _Control_ and _Database_ VMs include co-located jobs that normally run on a single VM in Elastic Runtime. See the next sections for details. 

For more information about the components mentioned on this page, see the _Architecture_ section of the [Elastic Runtime Concepts](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/index.html) guide. 

### <a id='controlvm'></a>Control VM

The Control VM includes the Elastic Runtime jobs that handle management plane operations, app lifecycles, logging, and user authorization and authentication. Additionally, all errands run on the Control VM, eliminating the the need for a VM for each errand and significantly reducing the time it takes to run errands. 

The following image shows all the jobs from Elastic Runtime that are co-located on the Control VM in Small Footprint Elastic Runtime.

### <a id='dbvm'></a>Database VM

The database VM includes the Elastic Runtime jobs that handle internal storage and messaging. 

The following image shows all the jobs from Elastic Runtime that are co-located on the Database VM in Small Footprint Elastic Runtime.

### <a id='computevm'></a>Compute VM

The _Compute_ VM is the same as the Diego Cell VM in Elastic Runtime.

### <a id='othervms'></a>Other VMs (Unchanged)

The following image shows the VMs that are exactly the same in both versions of the Elastic Runtime tile.

## <a id='install'></a>Installation

To install the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile, follow the instructions for [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html) on your IaaS. 

The installation and configuration is mostly the same as that of the Elastic Runtime tile, with the following differences:

* **Selecting a product in Pivotal Network**: When you navigate to the Elastic Runtime tile on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime), select the **Small Footprint** release. 

* **Securing communication between Diego and the Cloud Controller**: In the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile, these two components communicate securely by default. There is no selector to enable secure communication as there is in the Elastic Runtime tile. 

* **Configuring resources**: The **Resource Config** pane in the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile reflects the differences in VMs discussed in the _Architecture_ section of this topic.
