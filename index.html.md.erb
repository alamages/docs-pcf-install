This topic provides an overview of how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='sequence'></a>PCF Installation Sequence

PCF is a suite of products that runs on multiple IaaSes. Planning and installing PCF means building layers from the bottom up, starting with the details of your IaaS and ending with "Day 2" configurations that you perform on a installed and running PCF deployment.

Here's the typical PCF planning and installation process:

1. **Plan**
  - Review the Requirements for your IaaS ([AWS](./aws.html), [Azure](./azure.html), [GCP](./gcp.html), [OpenStack](./openstack.html), [vSphere](./vsphere.html)).
  - Refer to the Reference Architecture for your IaaS.
  - Assess your platform needs, including capacity, availability, container support, host OS, resource isolation, and geographical distribution. Discuss with your Pivotal contact.

1. **Deploy BOSH and Ops Manager**
  - [BOSH](http://bosh.io) is an open-source tool that lets you run software systems in the cloud.
      - BOSH and its IaaS-specific Cloud Provider Interfaces (CPIs) are what enable PCF to run on multiple IaaSes.
      - See [Deploying with BOSH](#bosh) for a mini description of the BOSH deployment process.
   - [Ops Manager](./ops-man.html) is a GUI application deployed by BOSH that streamlines deploying subsequent software to the cloud via BOSH.
      - Ops Manager represents PCF products as _tiles_ with multiple configuration panes that let you input or select configuration values needed for the product.
      - Ops Manager generates BOSH manifests containing the user-supplied configuration values, and sends them to the Director.
      - After you install Ops Manager and BOSH, you use Ops Manager to deploy almost all PCF products.
  - Deploying Ops Manager deploys both BOSH and Ops Manager with a single procedure.
      - On AWS, you can deploy Ops Manager manually, or automatically with a CloudFormation template.
      - On Azure, you can deploy Ops Manager manually, or automatically with an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. On Azure Government Cloud and Azure Germany you can only deploy Ops Manager manually.

1. **Deploy BOSH Add-ons** (Optional)
  - BOSH add-ons include the [IPsec](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec), [ClamAV](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-clamav), and [File Integrity Monitoring](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim), which enhance PCF platform security and security logging.
  - You deploy these add-ons via BOSH rather than installing them with Ops Manager tiles.

1. **Install PAS**
  - Developers use PAS (Pivotal Application Service) to develop and manage cloud-native apps and software services.
  - You can install the [Small Footprint Runtime](./small-footprint.html) as alternative to PAS. It uses far fewer VMs than PAS but has limitations.
  - PAS is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Application Runtime (formerly Elastic Runtime) project.
 
1. **Install Additional Runtimes** (Optional)
  - [PKS](http://docs-pks.cfapps.io) (Pivotal Container Service) uses BOSH to run and manage Kubernetes container clusters.
      - PKS is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Container Runtime (formerly Kubo) project.
  - [PCF Isolation Segment](./installing-pcf-is.html) lets a single PAS deployment run apps from separate, isolated pools of computing, routing, and logging resources.
      - Operators replicate and configure an Isolation Segment tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
  - [PAS for Windows 2016](https://docs-pas-windows.cfapps.io/pas-windows/index.html) enables PAS to manage host cells running Windows Server 2016, and lets developers push .NET apps to the Windows cells.
      - As with Isolation Segment runtime, Operators replicate and configure a PAS for Windows 2016 tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
  - [PAS for Windows 2012](https://docs-pas-windows.cfapps.io/pas-windows/index.html) enables PAS to manage Windows Server 2012 cells hosting .NET apps, and can also be replicated to create multiple isolated resource pools.

1. **Day 2 Configurations**
  - Day 2 configurations set up internal operations and external integrations on a running PCF platform.
      - Examples include front-end configuration, user accounts, logging and monitoring, internal security, and container and stemcell images.

1. **Install Services**
  - Install software services for PCF developers to use in their apps.
      - Services include the databases, caches, and message brokers that stateless cloud apps rely on to save information.
      - Installing and managing software services on PCF is an ongoing process, and is covered in the [PCF Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).

##<a id='bosh'></a>Deploying with BOSH

Here's how people use BOSH to run software in the cloud:

1. To use BOSH, you create a a _manifest_ `.yml` file that specifies your software system's component processes, the VMs they run on, how they communicate, and anything else they need.

2. The BOSH command-line interface (CLI) or API sends the manifest to the _Director_, BOSH's executive process.

3. The Director provisions what it needs from the IaaS, _deploys_ your software to run in the cloud, and heals automatically when VMs go down.

4. BOSH CLI and API commands let you control BOSH-managed processes and allocate or release IaaS resources.
