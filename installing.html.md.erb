To install the Small Footprint Elastic Runtime tile, follow the instructions for [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/installing/index.html) on your IaaS. The installation and configuration is the same as that of the Elastic Runtime tile. The only difference is that when you navigate to the Elastic Runtime tile on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime), you select the Small Footprint release.
