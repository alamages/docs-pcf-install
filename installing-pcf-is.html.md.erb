<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install the PCF Isolation Segment tile, which allows operators to isolate deployment workloads into dedicated resource pools called _isolation segments_. 

Installing the tile installs a single isolation segment. However, you can install multiple isolation segments using the Replicator tool documented in [Step 4](#copy).

After installing the tile, you must perform the steps in the [Create an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic to create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB). The topic also includes information about managing an isolation segment.

For more information about how isolation segments work, see the [Isolation Segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) section of the <Em>Understanding Cloud Foundry Security</em> topic. 

##<a id='routing'></a> Step 1: (Optional) Configure Routing

By default, the Elastic Runtime Router handles traffic for your isolation segment. However, you can deploy a dedicated router for your isolation segment instead. For information about configuring and managing routing for isolation segments, see the [Routing for Isolation Segments](../adminguide/routing-is.html) topic. 

To deploy a dedicated router, perform the following steps:

1. Add a load balancer in front of the Elastic Runtime Router. The steps to do this depend on your IaaS, but the setup of the load balancer should mirror the setup of the load balancer for the Elastic Runtime Router that you configured in the Elastic Runtime tile.
1. Create a wildcard DNS entry for traffic routed to any app in the isolation segment. For example, `*.iso.example.com`.
1. Attach the wildcard DNS entry to the load balancer you created.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

Perform the following steps to install the PCF Isolation Segment tile:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/isolation-segment).

1. Navigate to `YOUR-OPSMAN-FQDN` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Import a Product** and select the downloaded product file.

1. Under **PCF Isolation Segment** in the left column, click the plus sign.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure the Tile

Click the orange **PCF Isolation Segment** tile to start the configuration process.<br>

### <a id='az_networks'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

Perform the following steps to configure the PCF Isolation Segment tile: 

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

	<%= image_tag('isolation-segment/az-network.png') %>

1. Select an availability zone for your singleton jobs, and one or more availability zones to balance other jobs in. 

1. Select a network. This network does not need to be the same network where you deployed Elastic Runtime. For most deployments, operators should create  unique networks in which to deploy the Isolation Segment tile. These networks should maintain network reachability with the Diego components so that the cells can reach the Diego Brain and Diego Database VMs.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='networking'></a> Networking

<%= partial 'networking-is' %>

### <a id='application_containers'></a> Application Containers

Perform the following steps to configure the PCF Isolation Segment tile: 

1. Click **Application Containers**.

	<%= image_tag('isolation-segment/app-containers.png') %>

1. (Optional): Under **Private Docker Insecure Registry Whitelist**, enter one or more private Docker image registries that are secured with self-signed certificates. Use a comma-delimited list in the format `IP:Port` or `Hostname:Port`.

1. Under **Segment Name**, enter the name of your isolation segment. This name must be unique across your PCF deployment. You use this name when performing the steps in the [Create an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic to create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB).

1. By default, containers use the same DNS servers as the host. If you want to override the DNS servers to be used in the containers in the isolation segment, enter a comma-separated list of servers in **DNS Servers**.

1. Select your preference for **Docker Images Disk-Cleanup Scheduling on Cell VMs**. If you choose **Clean up disk-space once threshold is reached**, enter a **Threshold of Disk-Used** in megabytes. For more information about the configuration options and how to configure a threshold, see [Configuring Docker Images Disk-Cleanup Scheduling](../opsguide/config-cell-cleanup.html).

1. Under **Enabling NFSv3 volume services**, select **Enable** or **Disable**. NFS volume services allow application developers to bind existing NFS volumes to their applications for shared file access. For more information, see the [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html) topic.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In a clean install, NFSv3 volume services are enabled by default. In an upgrade, NFSv3 volume services match the setting of the previous deployment.</p>
    <%= image_tag('er-config-app-vol-svc.png') %>
1. (Optional) To configure LDAP for NFSv3 volume services, perform the following steps:
  * For **LDAP Service Account User**, enter the username of the service account in LDAP that  will manage volume services.
  * For **LDAP Service Account Password**, enter the password for the service account.
  * For **LDAP Server Host**, enter the hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.
  * For **LDAP Server Port**, enter the LDAP server port number. If you do not specify a port number, Ops Manager uses 389.
  * For **LDAP Server Protocol**, enter the server protocol. If you do not specify a protocol, Ops Manager uses TCP.
  * For **LDAP User Fully-Qualified Domain Name**, enter the fully qualified path to the LDAP service account. For example, if you have a service account called `volume-services` that belongs to organizational units (OU) called `service-accounts` and `my-company`, and your domain is called `domain`, the fully qualified path looks like the following:
  <pre>CN=volume-services,OU=service-accounts,OU=my-company,DC=domain,DC=com</pre>

1. By default, ERT manages container images using the [GrootFS](../concepts/architecture/garden.html#garden-rootfs) plugin for Garden-runC. If you experience issues with GrootFS, you can disable the plugin and use the image plugin built into Garden-runC.

1. Click **Save**.
 
### <a id='syslog'></a> System Logging

1. In the **System Logging** menu, select an option from the  **Do you want to configure syslog for system components?** menu. **No** is selected by default. 
<%= image_tag('./images/iso-logging-no.png') %>

1. If you want to use syslog, select **Yes.**
<%= image_tag('./images/iso-logging-yes.png') %>

1. Enter the address of your external syslog aggregation service in the **Address** field. The address can be a hostname or IP address.

1. Enter a port number in the **Port** field. 

1. Select a protocol from the **Transport Protocol** menu. This is the protocol the sytem uses to transmit logs to syslog.

1. (Optional) Select the **Enable TLS** option if you want to transmit logs over TLS.

1. Enter a **Permitted Peer.**

1. Paste the certificate for your TLS certificate authority (CA) in the **TLS CA Certificate** field.

1. Click **Save.**

### <a id='advanced_features'></a> Advanced Features

Edit the configurations in **Advanced Features** as desired.

### <a id='resources'></a> Configure Router Resources

1. Select **Resource Config**. 
  <%= image_tag('isolation-segment/resource-config.png') %>
1. If you are using a dedicated router for your isolation segment, follow the instructions below. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The configuration settings available in <strong>Resource Config</strong> vary depending on your IaaS.</p>
  * **If you have the Load Balancers column in your Resource Config**:    
      * Enter the wildcard DNS entry attached to your load balancer into the **Router** row under **Load Balancers**.
  * **If you do not have the Load Balancers column in your Resource Config**:
      * Navigate to the **Networking** section of the **PCF Isolation Segment** tile.
      * Specify **Router IPs**.
      * Attach the IP addresses to your load balancer manually.
1. If you are not using HAProxy for this isolation segment, set the number of **Instances** to `0`. 

### <a id='stemcell'></a> Stemcell

Optionally, edit the **Stemcell** configuration.

### <a id='after_config'></a> After Tile Configuration

After you configure the PCF Isolation Segment tile, perform the following steps:

1. Create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller Database (CCDB) by following the procedure in the [Create an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) section of the <em>Managing Isolation Segments</em> topic.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

After the tile finishes deploying, see the [Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic for more information about managing an isolation segment.

##<a id='copy'></a> Step 4: (Optional) Copy the Tile

If you want to create multiple isolation segments, perform the following steps to copy the PCF Isolation Segment tile with the Replicator tool:

1. Download the Replicator tool from the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Isolation Segment** section of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/isolation-segment).

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Replicator tool.

1. Replicate the tile:
	<pre class="terminal">
	./replicator \
    	-name "YOUR-NAME" \
    	-path /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL.pivotal \
    	-output /PATH/TO/COPY.pivotal
	</pre>

	Replace the values above with the following:
	* `YOUR-NAME`: Provide a unique name for the new PCF Isolation Segment tile. The name must be ten characters or less and only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces.
	* `/PATH/TO/ORIGINAL`: Provide the absolute path to the original PCF Isolation Segment tile you downloaded from Pivotal Network.
	* `/PATH/TO/COPY`: Provide the absolute path for the copy that the Replicator tool produces.

1. Follow the procedures in this topic using the new `.pivotal` file, starting with [Step 1](#routing).
