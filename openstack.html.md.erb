This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack.

## <a id='versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

PCF is supported on the OpenStack Liberty, Mitaka, and Newton releases. OpenStack is a collection of interoperable components and requires general OpenStack expertise to troubleshoot issues that may occur when installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on particular releases and distributions.

In addition, to verify that your OpenStack platform is compatible with PCF, you can use the [OpenStack Validator Tool](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-openstack-validator).

## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisites ##

The following sections describe general requirements for running PCF and specific requirements for running PCF on OpenStack.

<%= partial 'requirements' %>

### <a id="openstack"></a>OpenStack Requirements ##

To deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack, you must have a dedicated OpenStack project (formerly known as an OpenStack tenant) that meets the requirements described in this section.

* You must have Keystone access to the OpenStack tenant, including the following:

  * Auth URL
  * Username and password
  * Project name
  * Region (with multiple availability zones if you require high availability)
  * SSL certificate for your wildcard domain (see below)

* You must have the ability to do the following:

  * Create and modify VM flavors. See the [VM flavor configuration table](#vm-flavors)
  * Enable DHCP if required
  * Create a network and then connect that network with a router to an external network
  * Create an external network with a pool of floating IPs
  * Boot VMs directly from image
  * Create two wildcard domains for separate system and app domains

* Your OpenStack project must have the following resources before you install PCF:

  * 118 GB of RAM
  * 22 available instances
  * 16 small VMs (1 vCPU, 1024 MB of RAM, 10 GB of root disk)
  * 3 large VMs (4 vCPU, 16384 MB of RAM, 10 GB of root disk)
  * 3 extra-large VMs (8 vCPU, 16 GB of RAM, 160 GB of ephemeral disk)
  * 56 vCPUs
  * 1 TB of storage
  * Nova or Neutron networking with floating IP support
  
  By default, Elastic Runtime deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling Elastic Runtime](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).

* Requirements for your Cinder backend:

  * PCF requires RAW root disk images. The Cinder backend for your OpenStack project must support RAW.
  * Pivotal recommends that you use a Cinder backend that supports snapshots. This is required for some BOSH functionalities.
  * Pivotal recommends enabling your Cinder backend to delete block storage asynchronously. If this is not possible, it must be able to delete multiple 20GB volumes within 300 seconds.

* Using an Overlay Network with VXLAN or GRE Protocols:

  * If an overlay network is being used with VXLAN or GRE protocols, the MTU of the created VMs must be adjusted to the best practices recommended by the plugin vendor (if any).
  * DHCP must be enabled in the internal network for the MTU to be assigned to the VMs automatically.
  * Review the [Installing Elastic Runtime on OpenStack](../customizing/openstack-er-config.html#networking) topic to adjust your MTU values.
  * Failure to configure your overlay network correctly could cause Apps Manager to fail since applications will not be able to connect to the UAA.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using IPsec, your resource usage will increase by approximately 36 bytes. View the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html"> Installing IPsec topic</a> for information, including setting correct MTU values.</p>

* Miscellaneous

  * Pivotal recommends granting complete access to the OpenStack logs to the operator managing the installation process.
  * Your OpenStack environment should be thoroughly tested and considered stable before deploying PCF. To validate that your OpenStack platform meets the needs of PCF, you can use the [OpenStack Validator Tool](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-openstack-validator).
